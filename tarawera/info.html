                        <h2>Mt. Tarawera</h2>
                        <hr />
                        <p>Lying 24 kilometres south of Rotorua, Mt. Tarawera is a lava dome volcano consisting of three prominent dome peaks with a central fissure, Mt. Tarawera is responsible for the largest eruption in New Zealand in the last 500 years.</p>
                        <h4 id="formation">Formation</h4>
                        <p>18,000 years ago the first eruptions that created what we now know as Mt. Tarawera began. These eruptions were (and still are) caused by the Pacific plate spreading (due to mantle convection currents) and subducting under the Australian plate. As the Pacific plate subducts, it rubs against the Australian plate, producing heat through friction, this heat melts parts of the plate, forming magma, this magma then rises through the crust and, in this case, into the Taupo Volcanic Zone and subsequently to Mt. Tarawera.</p>
                        <p>For a clearer picture of how the plates interacted, and in that process how Mt. Tarawera and the Taupo Volcanic Zone was formed, see GNS Science's video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6Nyr78Mqyg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>Mt. Tarawera itself is a series of lava domes, the early lava domes are all covered in rhyolitic (a rock when molten is very viscous) debris, meaning that the early domes were likely formed by slow, viscous rhyolitic lava flows. These domes were formed when rhyolitic lava covered the vents and caused them to swell and inflate from inside. The later domes, and most prominent are thought to have been formed in an eruption around about a thousand years ago, once again these domes were formed with rhyolitic lava. The 1886 eruption of Mt. Tarawera was different to previous eruptions, the 1886 was a scoria (basalt based rock) eruption, rather than a rhyolitic eruption, that blasted out a roughly 17 kilometre long fissure vent</p>
                        <h4>Surface Features</h4>
                        <p>The most notable surface features of Mt. Tarawera are:</p>
                        <ul class="dashed">
                            <li>Shape</li>
                            <li>Surrounding lakes</li>
                            <li>Pyroclastic Flows</li>
                            <li>Lahar</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Shape</h5>
                        <h6>Lava Domes</h6>
                        <p>Mt. Tarawera is composed of many rhyolitic lava domes, which started forming around 18, 000 years ago. It is three of these lava domes that form the distinct, flat-topped, three peak, profile of Mt. Tarawera. The distinct shape of Tarawera is largely to do with way the lava domes that make up Tarawera formed. As previously mentioned, the Tarawera lava domes were formed when the viscous rhyolitic lava covered the vent, causing the vent to inflate. The fully formed lava dome has a flat top and sharp, cliff-like sides. These cliff-like sides tend to erode quite quickly, with landslides leaving debris around the base of Tarawera, the erosion is especially noticeable on the older domes, which have shallower angled sides, whereas the newer domes have retained their sharp sides.</p>
                        <h6>Fissure Vent</h6>
                        <p>The eruption in 1886 left a noticeable scar on the landscape of Tarawera, a fissure vent that runs 17 km along the three main domes and through and out the other side of what is now Lake Rotomahana.</p>
                        <h5>Surrounding Lakes</h5>
                        <p>Mt. Tarawera is surrounded by lakes that shape is dependent on Mt. Tarawera and the surrounding volcanoes.</p>
                        <h6>Lake Rotomahana</h6>
                        <p>Before 1886 Lake Rotomahana was a much smaller lake and home of the famous pink and white terraces. The 1886 eruption destroyed Lake Rotomahana, the pink and white terraces and the smaller Rotomakariki. The eruption left behind a 17 km long fissure that spread across the three main domes and down into where the Lake Rotomahana and the pink and white terraces used to lie. Once the eruption was over, the area where Rotomahana, the pink and white terraces and Lake Rotomakariki used to lie was slowly filled with water. After roughly 15 years, modern Lake Rotomohana was fully formed.</p>
                        <h6>Lake Tarawera</h6>
                        <p>North-west of Mt. Tarawera lies the expansive Lake Tarawera. The area around Lake Tarawera was stripped of vegetation by the 1886 eruption of Mt. Tarawera, Lake Tarawera's water level temporarily rose after the 1886 eruption when a dam formed where Lake Tarawera flows into Tarawera River. This dam was destroyed by a lahar years later and Lake Tarawera returned to its pre-1886 water level. Lake Tarawera gave one of the few warnings that Mt. Tarawera was about to erupt,a series of larger than usual waves were seen on the surface of Lake Tarawera, 9 days before the eruption itself. The same day, tourists claimed to have seen a Māori war canoe on Lake Tarawera.</p>
                        <h6>Frying Pan Lake</h6>
                        <p>Located in Echo crater is Frying Pan Lake. Echo Crater is apart of the 17 km long rift formed by the 1886 eruption of Mt. Tarawera. It took till 1917, when Echo Crater erupted, for Frying Pan Lake to fully fill.</p>
                        <h5>Pyroclastic Flows</h5>
                        <p>A pyroclastic flow occurs when a column of ash and dust becomes denser than the atmosphere and can no longer stay afloat. The column crashes to the ground, spreading in speeds excess of 200 kmh. Anything standing in its path will be destroyed in an avalanche of hot ash and mud. Pyroclastic flows were responsible for most of the deaths that occured in the 1886 eruption of Mt. Tarawera. Not all pyroclastic flows occur in this style, another particular style of pyroclastic flow that can occur at Mt. Tarawera is a “hot avalanche“. These hot avalanches occur when the side of a growing lava dome collapses, causing hot ash, dust and gas to hurtle down the side of the lava dome. The most recent hot avalanches that happened at Mt. Tarawera were during an eruption 800 years ago, when parts of the three main domes, with hot avalanches spreading up to 10 km away.</p>
                        <h5>Lahars</h5>
                        <p>A lahar is a mudflow produced when volcanic debris mixes with water, typically with a consistency much like that of wet concrete. All eruptions at Mt. Tarawera in around the last 10,000 years were followed by a lahar, typically down the Tarawera River.</p>
