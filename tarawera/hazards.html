                        <h2>Hazards</h2>
                        <hr />
                        <p>If Mt. Tarawera were to erupt again there would be devastation in the area, that’s a given. But, what isn’t a given is the type of eruption, While Mt. Tarawera has been rhyolitic for most of its recorded history, the most recent eruption in 1886 was a drastic change from this, Mt. Tarawera erupted scoria and basalt.</p>
                        <h5>Rhyolite</h5>
                        <p>If, next time Mt. Tarawera erupts, it were to erupt rhyolite we’d be facing an eruption with huge volumes of lava and a very violent eruption. Luckily we’d likely have plenty of time to evacuate and prepare as rhyolitic eruptions give off many warning signs, long before the eruption event itself. Including earthquakes, ground deformation, lake size changes and lake water level changes. Hopefully because of this time we’d have to prepare, loss would be at minimum.</p>
                        <h5>Basalt</h5>
                        <p>A basalt eruption however would have very little lava compared to a rhyolitic eruption. But, a basalt eruption would have very little warning, and very little time to evacuate the area. In the case of the 1886 eruption, it wasn’t till an hour before the eruption itself that any noticeable earthquakes occured. Because of this, loss of life may be greater.</p>

                        <p>Regardless of the type of eruption, most of the ensuing effects would be the same, just on a greater scale if the eruption was a rhyolitic eruption. Some of the effects would be:</p>
                        <ul class="dashed">
                            <li>Pyroclastic Flows</li>
                            <li>Lahars</li>
                            <li>Lava Flows</li>
                            <li>Hot Avalanches</li>
                            <li>Hydrothermal Eruptions</li>
                            <li>Volcanic Gases</li>
                            <li>Forest Fires</li>
                            <li>Flooding</li>
                            <li>Earthquakes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Pyroclastic Flows</h5>
                        <p>A pyroclastic flow occurs when a column of ash and dust becomes denser than the atmosphere and can no longer stay afloat. The column crashes to the ground, spreading in speeds excess of 200 kmh. Anything standing in its path will be destroyed in an avalanche of hot ash and mud.</p>
                        <h5>Lahars</h5>
                        <p>A lahar is a mudflow produced when volcanic debris mixes with water, typically with a consistency much like that of wet concrete.</p>
                        <h5>Lava Flows</h5>
                        <p>A lava flows are slow moving flows of molten rock originating from a volcanic vent. The lava can either be erupted via non-explosive means or more explosive lava columns.</p>
                        <h5>Hot Avalanches</h5>
                        <p>Hot avalanches occur when the side of a growing lava dome collapses, causing hot ash, dust and gas to hurtle down the side of the lava dome.</p>
                        <h5>Hydrothermal Eruptions</h5>
                        <p>Also known as steam eruptions, hydrothermal eruptions are caused by buildup of pressure in geothermal systems, normally caused by seismic or volcanic activity resulting in an explosion of steam. Normally a hydrothermal eruption will eject water vapour but sometimes large amounts of mud will be ejected as well, this was the case in 1886 when the Tarawera eruption caused hydrothermal eruptions in Lake Rotomahana, some of this mud caused buildings to collapse.</p>
                        <h5>Volcanic Gases</h5>
                        <p>Volcanic gases are emitted during a volcanic eruption, these gases are normally carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Sometimes resulting in acid rain.</p>
                        <h5>Forest Fires</h5>
                        <p>Mt. Tarawera and the surrounding areas are covered in flammable vegetation, a volcanic eruption could cause huge forest fires in the general area of the volcano, causing damage to the environment and buildings.</p>
                        <h5>Flooding</h5>
                        <p>A lot of the lakes in the general area of Mt. Tarawera are only separated from each other or valleys by small land barriers, if any of these were to collapse, extreme flooding could ensue as huge amounts of water flow between lakes, causing them to drastically rise, destroying buildings and surrounding roads. In other places the lakes could breach and flood huge regions, causing widespread devastation, flooding all sorts of infrastructure.</p>
                        <h5>Volcanic Earthquakes</h5>
                        <p>With any volcanic event it is likely an earthquake will accompany, these earthquakes can cause damage to infrastructure and cause other hazardous events to occur, i.e. flooding, avalanches.</p>
