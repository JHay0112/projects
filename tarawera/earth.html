                        <hr />
                        <h4>Layers of the Earth</h4>
                        <h5>Crust</h5>
                        <p>The crust is the most outer layer and the thinnest layer of the earth. It ranges from 1 - 60 km thick. The crust is the solid layer that we live on and only accounts for roughly 1% of earth’s total volume. The crust is made up of sections called plates that "float" on the denser mantle (Click <a href="#plates">here</a> for more about plates).</p>
                        <h5>Upper Mantle</h5>
                        <p>The upper mantle extends from the end of the crust to about 410 km deep. While most of the upper mantle is solid the softer regions tend to be linked to tectonic and volcanic activity. The upper mantle is normally split into two sections, the lithosphere and asthenosphere. The lithosphere encompasses both the crust and the upper, more brittle portion of the upper mantle extending down roughly 100 km. The lithosphere is where tectonic activity occurs. The asthenosphere accounts for the rest of the upper mantle, extending from roughly 100 km down to 410 km. The asthenosphere is much denser and weaker than the lithosphere.</p>
                        <h5>Lower Mantle</h5>
                        <p>The lower mantle extends from roughly 660 km down to about 2,700 km. Between the upper and lower mantle there is an area known as the “transition zone” which contains large amounts of water in the form of hydroxides and slows down exchange of material between the two mantle sections. The lower mantle is much hotter than the upper mantle but the extreme pressure keeps the rocks solid. There is very little known about the lower mantle.</p>
                        <h5>Outer Core</h5>
                        <p>The outer core rests below the lower mantle and above the inner core. The outer core is composed of molten iron and nickel. The outer core has temperatures around 5,000 degree celsius.</p> 
                        <h5>Inner Core</h5>
                        <p>The inner core is the most inner and hottest part of the earth with temperatures reaching 5,500 degrees celsius. Like the outer core, the inner core is mostly composed of iron and nickel although the inner core is solid, unlike the outer core.</p>

                        <h4 id="plates">Tectonic Plates</h4>
                        <p>The crust of the earth is not one solid shell, it is made up of pieces we call “plates”, these plates “float” on top of the denser mantle. Over millennia these plates slowly move in a process commonly known as continental drift. The driving force behind this movement is thought to be convection currents in the mantle.</p>
                        <h5>Convection Currents</h5>
                        <p>Mantle convection currents are like any other type of convection current, mantle heated by the core rises and cold, dense mantle sinks only to be heated and begin the process again. When the hot mantle rises it creates what is called a divergent boundary, at a divergent boundary, magma can rises, causing two plates to spread.</p>
                        <h5>Plate Boundaries</h5>
                        <p>There are three types of plate boundary:</p>
                        <ul class="dashed">
                            <li>Divergent Boundaries (Previously mentioned), where two plates spread.</li>
                            <li>Convergent Boundaries, where two plates collide.</li>
                            <li>Transform Boundaries, where two plates slide past each other.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Divergent Boundaries</h6>
                        <p>Divergent Boundaries, as previously mentioned are where two plates spread apart. Iceland lies on a divergent boundary, between the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Divergent boundaries tend to be areas of high volcanic activity.</p>
                        <h6>Convergent Boundaries</h6>
                        <p>Convergent Boundaries are where two plates collide, usually causing one plate to subduct other the other. Which one subducts, and what surface features are formed, is dictated by what type of plates are colliding. There are two types of plates, oceanic and continental plates, oceanic plates are much denser and thinner than continental plates and, surprise, are found under the ocean. The thicker but less dense continental plates make up land masses (e.g. Eurasia).</p>
                        <p>Convergent Boundaries - Continental Plates</p>
                        <p>When two continental plates meet at a convergent boundary one of the two will subduct under the other as the two plates collide a mountain range will be formed. As one of the plates subducts friction caused by the subduction will heat some of the rock, turning it into magma, this magma can then rise and create volcanoes. Mt. Horrible near Timaru is an example of one of these volcanoes.</p>
                        <p>Convergent Boundaries - Oceanic Plates</p>
                        <p>Oceanic plates colliding at a convergent boundary behave much the same, creating an undersea mountain range, sometimes forming islands.</p>
                        <p>Convergent Boundaries - Oceanic and Continental Plates</p>
                        <p>When a oceanic plate and a continental plate collide at a convergent boundary it will always be the oceanic plate that subducts. Other than that the details are much the same for the other types of collisions.</p>
                        <h6>Transformative Boundaries</h6>
                        <p>A transformative boundary is where two plates slide past each other, transformative boundaries tend to generate the most violent earthquakes.</p>
